            <h4><b>1.</b> The Inheritance Games</h4>
            <h6 class="author">Jennifer Lynn Barnes</h6>
            <p class="indent">
                Avery Grambs has a plan for a better future: survive high school, win a scholarship, and get out. 
                But her fortunes change in an instant when billionaire Tobias Hawthorne dies and leaves Avery virtually 
                his entire fortune. The catch? Avery has no idea why - or even who Tobias Hawthorne is.
                <br>
                To receive her inheritance, Avery must move into sprawling, secret passage-filled Hawthorne House, 
                where every room bears the old man's touchâ€”and his love of puzzles, riddles, and codes. Unfortunately 
                for Avery, Hawthorne House is also occupied by the family that Tobias Hawthorne just dispossessed. This 
                includes the four Hawthorne grandsons: dangerous, magnetic, brilliant boys who grew up with every 
                expectation that one day, they would inherit billions. Heir apparent Grayson Hawthorne is convinced that 
                Avery must be a con-woman, and he's determined to take her down. His brother, Jameson, views her as their 
                grandfather's last hurrah: a twisted riddle, a puzzle to be solved. Caught in a world of wealth and 
                privilege, with danger around every turn, Avery will have to play the game herself just to survive.
